All - Here are some queries you can use in MySQL or with MySQL Workbench to view the tables joins
Notes:  - Make sure you are in the database first by using the mysql command: use workout_db; 

1. Scheduledexercises table with exercies table joined:  
    SELECT * FROM scheduledexercises 
        LEFT JOIN exercises ON scheduledexercises.exercise_id = exercises.exercise_id;

2. Scheduledexercises table with exercies table and musclegroup table joined:  
    SELECT * FROM scheduledexercises 
        LEFT JOIN exercises ON scheduledexercises.exercise_id = exercises.exercise_id
        LEFT JOIN musclegroup ON exercises.musclegroup_id = musclegroup.musclegroup_id; 

3.  muscle table with musclegroup table joined: 
    SELECT * FROM muscle JOIN musclegroup ON muscle.musclegroup_id = musclegroup.musclegroup_id; 

4.  exercies table with musclegroup table joined 
    select * from musclegroup left join exercises on musclegroup.musclegroup_id = exercises.musclegroup_id;
